## Sound System

The game generates all sounds procedurally using numpy waveform synthesis:

- **Rockets** - Whooshing launch sound
- **Lasers** - High-frequency Amarr beam
- **Explosions** - Scaled by enemy size (small/medium/large)
- **Shield/Armor/Hull hits** - Distinct damage feedback
- **Pickups** - Hopeful arpeggio for refugees, bright sweep for powerups
- **UI sounds** - Menu selection, purchase confirmation, error buzzer

Sound gracefully disables if no audio device is available.
